TODO:

* Find source for FPS-counter/trace time discrepancy
* Rename OpenCL{Renderer,BoundNSplit} & PatchDrawer
* GPU-based Bound&Split for OpenCL Renderer
  * Keep CPU-version available for comparison
* Pipeline drawcalls over several command-queues
* Implement Gregory patches (+Blender export script for catmull-clark)
* Write polygon size estimation shader
* Implement dynamic-rate dicing
* Switch readme to markdown/textile or something like that
* Add SCons build dir and config-option
* Make CL::TransferBuffer use pinned memory again

* Check for potential ways to get direct access to default framebuffer

* Read:
  'Fast GPU-based Adaptive Tessellation with CUDA'
  'Fragment-Parallel Composite and Filter'
  '3D Rasterization: A Bridge between Rasterization and Ray Casting'
  'Task Management for Irregular-Parallel Workloads on the GPU'

* Shader system
  * Use Python for generation/compilation
  * Noise functions

* Use GL sync objects once available

* Implement multisampling
* Implement stochastic rasterization

DONE

* Use glfwGetGLXContext() etc. to get context/display in shared CL/GL device setup
* Check out default framebuffer properties with glGetFramebufferAttachmentParameteriv() 
* Refactor OpenCL wrappers
  * User-events
  * Dump trace when pressing button
  * Make Events shareable within device
  * Add device-level trace generation
  * Split into individual files
  * Add set_args intermediate in CL::Kernel
* Fix range_id/patch_id name inconsistencies
* Rename PatchesIndex to PatchIndex
* Fix configgen.py warning issues and switch to Python3+Wheezy
* Switch formatMapGen to Python3+Wheezy
* Add to github
* Configurable Precision
* Calculate B&S time
* Add and check hash of config file to avoid unnecessary safe
* Read DiagSplit paper
* Make SCons react to changes in tools dir
* Freecam
* Rework Bound & Split dataflow
* Load Killeroo
* More complex scene format
  * Configurable Camera
* Catmull-Clark SDS
