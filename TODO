* Debug deadlock/artifact problems in LOCAL B&S kernels
* Find clCreateUserEvent leak CodeXL is reporting
* Implement task donation/stealing on top of Local B&S kernels
* Rename reyes_patches_per_pass to grids_per_pass or something like that
  * Consider generally cleaning up config options
* Investigate Intel vectorization problems in bound_n_split kernel
  * Maybe there's Intel tools that help with finding vectorization problems?
* Clean up Projection class
  * Only update when necessary
* Replace "CL/OpenCL.h" includes with direct includes to necessary classes.
* Implement Gregory patches (+Blender export script for catmull-clark)
* Write polygon size estimation shader
* Implement dynamic-rate dicing
* Switch readme to markdown/textile or something like that
* Add SCons build dir and config-option
* Query ideal work group size and use that for bound_n_split kernels
  * Also pick local stack size (vs. spill region) that way

* Find source for driver crash when switching to OpenGL backend
  * This only happens on R9 290X -> Switched back to HD 7970
  * Perhaps try setting up a minimal debug case for 
  
* Make more use of
  * __attribute__((work_group_size_hint(X,Y,Z)))
  * __attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(X,Y,Z)))

* Improve on parse_trace.py output
  * Queue name in bold
  * (Colored) vertical lines for orientation?
  * Method for combining commands into single one

* Debug weird trace behavior where patch-range transfer seem to happen after depending dice/shade/sample
* Investigate cause of ~2ms extra latency when creating framebuffers >800x600

* Find source for FPS-counter/trace time discrepancy
* Check for potential ways to get direct access to default framebuffer

* Read:
  * 'Fast GPU-based Adaptive Tessellation with CUDA'

* Shader system
  * Use Python for generation/compilation?
  * Noise functions

* Use GL sync objects once available

* Consider switching to ImageBuffers for framebuffer
* Implement multisampling
* Implement stochastic rasterization


DONE:

* Split B&S header files
* React more gracefully on missing input files and mistyped arguments
* Add save-scene feature to save camera position (and perhaps other stuff)
* Implement/recover CPU B&S for GL backend
* Dump several traces in trace dump mode
* Plot figures in benchmark.py with matplotlib

* Implement BoundNSplitCLMultipass
* Use dump-mode to write a benchmark script that tries out many different setting combinations
  * use trace parsing code to calculate performance characteristics
* rename parse_trace.py and  and move actual trace parsing into separate file for reuse
* Add config options to dump trace and exit app after N frames
  * for scripted performance measurement
* Create command-dependency graph dump (In DOT format)
  * Integrated in trace instead
* Clean up parse_trace.py
  * Rename script to something more fitting
  * Time markers on scale
  * Visualize event dependencies
* Debug regression with Intel rasterizer black pixels
  * Only happens in debug build
  * Same thing happens in AMD CPU backend
* Handle output buffer overflow by writing stack back to input queue
* Rename *BoundNSplit* classes to BoundNSplit(CL|GL)(CPU|Local|Multipass)
* Rename *Renderer classes to Renderer(CL|GL)*
* Use distributed queuing to parallelize bns
* Make number of work groups in local bound-n-split kernel configurable
* Read Stanley & Anjul's scheduling paper!
* Automatically resize scratch-buffer for input buffers in OpenCLBoundNSplitLocal
* Make CL::TransferBuffer use pinned memory again
* Handle output buffer in overflow properly
* GPU-based Bound&Split for OpenCL Renderer
  * Keep CPU-version available for comparison
* Make type of Bound&Split method configurable (CPU,LOCAL,ITERATIVE (pick better names))
  * Chose CPU, MULTIPASS, LOCAL
* Avoid Bound&Split stalls
* Move stuff from BoundNSplit to OpenCLBoundNSplit
* Remove config.max_block_assignments
* Rename config.patch_buffer_count
* Reorder config so patch_size and bound_n_split limit are side by side
* Debug source of pipeline stalls
* Write more compact patch evaluation kernel
* Pipeline drawcalls over several command-queues
  * Didn't help as much as hoped
* Rename OpenCL{Renderer,BoundNSplit} & PatchDrawer
  * Only renamed PatchDrawer
* Use glfwGetGLXContext() etc. to get context/display in shared CL/GL device setup
* Check out default framebuffer properties with glGetFramebufferAttachmentParameteriv()
