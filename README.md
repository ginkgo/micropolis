```


Micropolis is a micropolygon rasterizer implemented in OpenCL. 

It uses the REYES[1] algorithm to rasterize curved surfaces. This is
done by splitting the surface into sub-pixel sized polygons (micropolygons) 
and rasterizing them. Doing so allows the rendering of highly detailed, displaced 
surfaces.

The dicing, shading and rasterization of the micropolygons is implemented in
OpenCL. The rasterizer fills a framebuffer that is then rendered as
texture in OpenGL. 
There also exists an alternative render backend that uses OpenGL hardware
tessellation for performance comparison.

## COMPILATION


You will need the following dependencies to build micropolis on Linux:

- SCons
- GLFW 3.0
- Boost
- OpenCL
- DevIL
- Python 3.x
- Wheezy template
- Cap'n Proto

The source uses some C++11 features, so you need a version of GCC recent enough
to support this.

To build call:

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ scons
```

The build-system uses code-generation for creating the config-file
parser and the OpenGL extension loader. This is done by two python
programs(configGen and flextGLgen) in the tools directory. They reside
in separate git submodules, so it is necessary to initialize and
update them before compiling with SCons.


## USAGE


Just call:

```
$ ./micropolis
```

You will see performance statistics on the command line.

Q or ESC close the application
Use WASD to move the camera
LMB+drag rotates the camera
MMB+drag moves the camera on the eye plane
RMB+drag rotates the camera along the z axis
PGUP/PGDOWN controls target patch size for Bound&Split algorithm
F3 toggles wireframe mode
F9 dumps a trace file which can be visualized using tools/show_trace.sh
F12 saves the current camera position as an mscene file
PRINT creates a screenshot

You can configure the program by modifying the *.options configuration files.
The files are pretty well-documented.

Interesting configuration-values are:

- `input_file`:
    The scene to render.
    Look in the mscene/ dir for scene files.

- `opencl_device_id`:
    A pair of numbers giving platform and device id of the OpenCL device that should be used.
     
- `reyes_patches_per_pass`:
    Sets how many sub-patches are diced and rasterized at once. Larger
    batches require more OpenCL device memory and take longer. Smaller
    batches have more overhead. You should set something between 256
    and 4096. Use powers of two.

- `bound_n_split_limit`:
    In the first step of REYES, all patches are split to this screen size.

- `reyes_patch_size`:
    The horizontal and vertical dicing rate of the split subpatches.
    Should ideally be the same as `bound_n_split_limit` to get
    pixel-sized micropolygons. More is a waste. Needs to be divisible by 8.
    

## LIMITATIONS


Micropolis is very much a prototype. It is limited in several ways:

- **Surface patches are diced at a fixed rate**
    This can lead to wasteful overtessellation
- **Surface cracks are not handled**
    This can result in holes between surface patches.
- **Micropolygons are always flat-shaded**
    Gouraud shading would result in fewer artifacts and most production
    renderers use it, but I don't really know how to calculate the vertex-
    normal of displaced vertices in an elegant way. This is especially 
    problematic at the borders of a surface.
- **No Multisampling or stochastic rasterization is supported**

Further limitations are

- **Surface shader and displacement are hard-coded in the OpenCL kernel**
- **Only a Bezier surface meshes are supported**
- **Only one object can be rendered at a time and only moved along the Z axis**
